# **Introduction to Lean**

**Author:** Florent Schaffhauser, Uni-Heidelberg, Summer Semester 2023

This is the GitHub repository for the *Introduction to Lean* part of the **(Pro)Seminar on computer-assisted mathematics**, held at the University of Heidelberg in the Summer Semester of 2023.

Below you will find the program of the seminar. For each week, there is a corresponding `.lean` file, which you can use to practice. You can also view a markdown version of the weekly files by clicking on the corresponding `.md` files.

In order to work on the `.lean` files, several options are available:

* Download the file (either manually or by cloning or forking this repository) and open it in your [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) account.
* Open it in *Codespaces* directly from the present repository. In that case, you may not be able to save your changes.
* Install *Lean 3* on your computer by following the instructions [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html). Be aware that *Lean 4* is not backwards-compatible with *Lean 3* and that the `.lean` files in this repository will not work in *Lean 4*.
